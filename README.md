# Titanic_Passenger_Survival_Prediction
A simple Flask web application that trains a Logistic Regression model on the Titanic dataset and lets users predict whether a passenger would survive by filling  web form. The app retrains the model every time the Flask process starts (so the model is always trained from the CSV on startup).
